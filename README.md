# Using Terraform to create AWS development environment

## Objective
In this project I will grow my infrastructure as code skills by using Terraform to automatically build me a remote development environment in AWS.

I will deploy a EC2 instance with a user data script to automatically install the tools I need to start devloping. I will deploy this EC2 instance in a public subnet and configure a route table and security group to allow me to SSH in the EC2 instance on my home computer.
